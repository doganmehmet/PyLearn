To make a python file (py) executable for os

1. Ensure the first line of your Python script is #!/usr/bin/env python
2. If encoding is needed (if you have special characters like Turkish, Chineese) add after the first line # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
3. Change the extension of the file to .command (i.e. If the file you want to make executable is called Test.py, change it to Test.command)
4. In Terminal make the Python script file executable by running chmod +x Test.command (obviously the Test.command will be whatever your file is from Step 2 above).


By following the above steps, you should be able to double-click your Python script within macOS Sierra and it will open a terminal window and run the script

In source header you can declare:

#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

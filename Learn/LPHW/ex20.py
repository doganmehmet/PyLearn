"""
How does readline() know where each line is? Inside readline() is code that scans each byte of the
file until it finds a \n character, then stops reading the file to return what it found so far. The file
f is responsible for maintaining the current position in the file after each readline() call, so that
it will keep reading each line.

"""


"""
Why are there empty lines between the lines in the file? The readline() function returns the \n thatâ€™s
in the file at the end of that line. Add a end = "" at the end of your print function calls to avoid
adding double \n to every line.
